# Health_care_project_OBD
This project analyzes clinical data related to Obsessive (OBD) and Compulsive Disorder (OCD) to identify patterns in diagnosis across gender, ethnicity, and time. Using SQL for data extraction and transformation and Power BI for visualization, the project highlights trends by gender, ethnicity, and month of diagnosis.

The objective of this analysis is to demonstrate data analytics skills while providing meaningful insights into mental health diagnosis patterns.

-- TOOLS
SQL (MySQL): Data cleaning, aggregation, and analysis
Power BI: Interactive dashboards and visual storytelling
Dataset: OCD patient clinical dataset (demographics, diagnosis dates, assessment scores)

-- Key Questions Explored
How do OCD diagnosis rates differ by gender?
Are there noticeable differences in diagnoses across ethnic groups?
Do OCD diagnoses show seasonal or monthly trends throughout the year?
What are the most common types of OBD and OCD?

-- Methodology
Data Preparation (SQL)
Queried patient-level data from a MySQL database
Aggregated counts and averages by gender, ethnicity, and month


-- Data Analysis
Calculated patient counts by demographic group
Analyzed average clinical scores (e.g., Y-BOCS)
Extracted month-level trends from diagnosis dates

-- Visualization (Power BI)
Created interactive dashboards with graphs for gender, ethnicity, and time
Used bar charts, line charts, and summary cards to present insights clearly

Run the SQL queries in the sql/ folder using MySQL
Load the cleaned/aggregated data into Power BI
Open the .pbix file to explore the interactive dashboard
